One file per channel. The agent reads this before writing any post.

# Channel: {Channel Name}

## About
- **Platform:** Telegram / YouTube / Newsletter / X / LinkedIn / etc.
- **URL / Handle:**
- **Topics:** What this channel covers
- **Audience:** Who reads/watches it
- **Language:**
- **Format:** Personal blog / News + commentary / Educational / Documentary / etc.
- **Default channel:** yes / no (is this where posts go when no channel is specified?)

## Tone
How the author sounds specifically on this channel — not in general, but here.
Compare briefly to other channels if useful.

Examples:
- "More analytical than the YouTube channel — drier, more data-driven"
- "More personal than the main channel — closer to a diary"
- "Same voice as Telegram but adapted for video pacing"

3–5 tone adjectives: direct, analytical, curious, honest, unsentimental...

## Post Structure

**Standard post:**
```
Opening: [how posts start — e.g., "straight to the thesis, no greeting"]
Body: [how ideas develop — e.g., "logic chain, not data dump"]
Close: [how it ends — e.g., "P.S. separates personal from analysis"]
```

**If there are multiple post types, describe each:**

Type A (e.g., market update):
```
[structure]
```

Type B (e.g., educational):
```
[structure]
```

## What's Never in Posts
- No hashtags
- No "Hi, today we'll talk about..."
- No exclamation point calls to action

- [add channel-specific prohibitions]

## Characteristic Phrases
These phrases appear in real posts. Reuse naturally, don't force.

- "Phrase one" — context when used
- "Phrase two" — context when used
- "Phrase three" — context when used
