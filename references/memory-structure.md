# Memory File Structure

## Three-Tier Architecture

The agent's memory is split into three layers. Read them in order each session.

| Tier | File | Purpose | Lifetime |
|------|------|---------|---------|
| **HOT** | `memory/hot/HOT_MEMORY.md` | Active drafts, current session tasks | Session only — clear at end |
| **WARM** | `memory/warm/WARM_MEMORY.md` | Stable facts: author, channels, rules | Long-term — change rarely |
| **COLD** | `MEMORY.md` | Session archive, feedback log | Permanent — append only |
