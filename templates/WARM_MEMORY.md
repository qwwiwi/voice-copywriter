# WARM MEMORY

_Stable facts: author profile, channels, golden rules._
_Change rarely — only when something fundamental changes._

## Author

- **Name:**
- **Handle / username:**
- **Timezone:**
- **Location:**
- **Projects:**

## Channels

| File | Channel | Platform | Topics |
|------|---------|----------|--------|
| `channel-main.md` | [Channel name] | Telegram / YouTube / etc. | [Topics] |

_Add one row per channel. Link to the channel-*.md file._

## What Goes Where

| Incoming content | File |
|---|---|
| External post / article / link / screenshot | `REFERENCES.md` |
| Author's own opinion or position | `MY_STANCE.md` |
| Content idea for a channel | `ideas-{channel}.md` |
| Style feedback ("I never write X") | `channel-{name}.md` (append) |

If unclear → ask: "Is this a reference or your own opinion?"

## Golden Rules

_Rules that apply everywhere, no exceptions._

- Never publish without author approval
- Always offer 1–2 variants, not a single "correct" version
- For YouTube: get outline approved before writing full script
- [Add your own rules here]
