# Tone of Voice

_Global style rules — apply to all channels._
_Distilled from real author texts. Updated every 5 library additions._
_Agent reads this before writing. Never modify without author approval._

---

## Voice

_How the author sounds. 3–5 sentences._

- [Example: Direct and confident. States opinions, doesn't hedge unnecessarily.]
- [Example: Starts with the point — no "Hi, today we'll talk about..."]
- [Example: Acknowledges uncertainty honestly: "I don't know, but my hypothesis is..."]

## Structure

_How texts are built._

- [Example: Short paragraphs — 2–4 sentences. One paragraph = one idea.]
- [Example: Opens with the thesis, not the context.]
- [Example: P.S. separates personal notes from the main content.]

## Language

- [Example: Mix of native language + English terms used naturally, without translation]
- [Example: Specific numbers always — never "approximately" or "around"]
- [Example: Quotes: use « » not " "]
- [Example: Dash: use – not —]

## Recurring Frames

_Mental models the author uses repeatedly._

- [Example: "Two scenarios" → eliminate one → pick the base case]
- [Example: Facts → "we don't know" → hypothesis ("possibly", "my guess")]
- [Example: "In reality..." as a transition to honest assessment]

## Prohibited

_Things that immediately break the voice. Never write these._

- No hashtags
- No "Hi, today we'll talk about..."
- No exclamation-point calls to action ("Buy now!")
- No promises without caveats
- No "What this means in practice:" / "Why this matters:" — write the meaning directly
- [Add your own prohibitions]

## Editing Rule

When the author sends their own version and asks for edits:
preserve their wording as much as possible. Do not "soften" strong conclusions.
Only fix what they explicitly asked for (errors, format, punctuation, structure).
